## 1. Установить Terraform.
---
  babaika_ko@instance-1:~$ terraform version
  Terraform v1.7.2
  on linux_amd64
## 2. Написать шаблон для создания виртуальной машины в облаке.
## 3. Познакомиться с командами:
- terraform init

      babaika_ko@instance-1:~/terraform-project$ terraform init
    
    Initializing the backend...
    
    Initializing provider plugins...
    - Finding latest version of hashicorp/google...
    - Installing hashicorp/google v5.14.0...
    - Installed hashicorp/google v5.14.0 (signed by HashiCorp)
    
    Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
    selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
    so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
    you run "terraform init" in the future.
    
    Terraform has been successfully initialized!
    
    You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
    any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
    should now work.
    
    If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
    rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
    commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

    babaika_ko@instance-1:~/terraform-project$ terraform plan

    Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated
    with the following symbols:
      + create
    
    Terraform will perform the following actions:

- terraform apply

- terraform destroy
## 4. Создать виртуальную машину в облаке при помощи ранее созданного шаблона.
## 5. Поменять тип виртуальной машины (увеличить количество ресурсов) через веб консоль и выполнить terraform plan. Что предлагает сделать Terraform?
